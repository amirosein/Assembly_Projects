# Assembly_Projects
 Assembly projects implemented for ATMEGA 16

# Projects

## Project 1
  Turning on LEDs with different switches. Working with ports/pins. Reading pins and writing on ports. 
  
## Project 2
  Writing a matrix based key-board. Using 7 Segments and LCD.
  
## Project 3
  Using Timer/Counter of ATMega 16 in different modes like Normal and CTC and turning on and off LEDs in certain points.
  
## Project 4
  Using ADC (Analog to Digital Comparator) in ATMEGA16

## Project 5
  Using USART in ATMEGA 16 and asynchronise connection with another device (PC)

## Project 6
  Interrupt management using 74LS244 input buffer and 82C82 latch connected to ATMEGA16. Interrupt routin to give services to a keyboard and printer for printing the pushed button.
